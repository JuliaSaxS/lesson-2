# Instruction for working in Markdown.

## Text selection.

## Lists.

To add unnumbered lists, you need to put a symbol (*) or (+) before each item in the list. For example, like this:
* Element 1
* Element 2
+ Element 3
+ Element 4
  
To add numbered lists, you need to number each item in the list. For example, like this:
1. Element 1
2. Element 2
3. Element 3

## Working with images.

To insert an image into the text, you need to write:
![It's a wolf.](wolf.jpg)

## Links.



## Working with tables.

## Quotes.

The sign (">") is used to indicate quotations.  It can be inserted both before each line of the quotation, and only before the first line of the paragraph. 

> This is an example quote,
> in which before each line
> a sign (">") is placed.
> 
> This is an example of a quote in which the sign (">") is placed only before the beginning of a new paragraph.
> 
> The second paragraph.

You can create nested quotes (quotes inside quotes). Additional signs (">") are used to mark them. 
It looks like this:

> First level
>> Second level
>>> Third level
