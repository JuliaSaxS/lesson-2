# Instruction for working in Markdown.

## Text selection.

To highlight the text in italics, you need to frame it with a symbol (*) or (_). For example *like this* or _like this_.

To highlight the text in bold, you need to frame it with two symbols (**) or (__). For example **like this** or __like this__.

Alternative ways to highlight text in italics and bold are needed to combine the use of these methods. For example, the _text can be italicized, but at the same time be **bold**_.

![It's a wolf.](wolf.jpg)
