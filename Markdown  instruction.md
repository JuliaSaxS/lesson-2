# Instruction for working in Markdown.

## Text selection.

Headings are highlighted using signs ("=") if the title is of the first level, and signs ("-") if the title is of the second level. The number of sings is unlimited. For example:

First level header.
=================
Second level header.
-------------------------
When highlighting headings with a sign ("#"), the sign is set in the header at the beginning of the line (before the header). The header level is determined by the number of initial characters (from 1 to 6). For example:
# First level.
### Third level.
#### Fifth level.

## Lists.

To add unnumbered lists, you need to put a symbol (*) or (+) before each item in the list. For example, like this:
* Element 1
* Element 2
+ Element 3
+ Element 4
  
To add numbered lists, you need to number each item in the list. For example, like this:
1. Element 1
2. Element 2
3. Element 3

## Working with images.

To insert an image into the text, you need to write:
![It's a wolf.](wolf.jpg)

## Links.



## Working with tables.

## Quotes.

The sign (">") is used to indicate quotations.  It can be inserted both before each line of the quotation, and only before the first line of the paragraph. 

> This is an example quote,
> in which before each line
> a sign (">") is placed.
> 
> This is an example of a quote in which the sign (">") is placed only before the beginning of a new paragraph.
> 
> The second paragraph.

You can create nested quotes (quotes inside quotes). Additional signs (">") are used to mark them. 
It looks like this:

> First level
>> Second level
>>> Third level
